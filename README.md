A game about greediness

A small application written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS that represents a game about rolling die. 2 players are competing by rolling a dice. The roll value is added to the current player's score. The player can keep rolling to acumulate more points but there is a catch. When a player rolls a 1 all of its current score goes back to 0 and now the other player has to roll. The player can also hold, meaning its current score gets transferred to its total score so there will be no lost points. When that happenes it's other player's turn. The objective is reaching a total score of 100 points.
